### Portfolio
    Due
        Sunday 26th September at 11.59pm.

    Description
        Kickstarter, Go Fund Me, Kiva, Change.org, Patreon... All of these different websites have something in common: they provide a platform for people to fund projects that they believe in, but they all have a slightly different approach. You are going to create your own crowdfunding website, and put your own spin on it!

    Project Requirements:
        Starter files are provided for this project. In the first session working on this project, as a class, we will go through those starter files and get everyone’s project up and running. Part 1 and Part 2 also have setup steps that we will do as a class. We strongly recommend that you refrain from starting Part 1 or Part 2 until after we have completed the setup in class.

    Submission Requirements:
        Please submit the following:
            ● A link to the GitHub repository containing the code for your project.
            ● A link to the deployed project.
            ● A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a successful GET method for any endpoint.
            ● A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a successful POST method for any endpoint.
            ● A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a token being returned.
            ● Step by step instructions for how to register a new user and create a new project (i.e. endpoints andbody data).
            ● Your refined API specification and Database Schema.

#### App Details
    Name:       CrowdMentor
    Tagline:    Linking dreamers with achievers
    Purpose:    Providing a platform to advertise development areas that 
                users are looking to improve on (such as soft skills, 
                leadership, physical work, technical work etc.)
    Audience:   Project Owners - Those with specific skill sets to develop
                Crowdfunders: Those with skills and time to mentor/tutor
    Exchange:   Reward based – not financial, funders are volunteers
    Example:    Project Owner: User adds a project that says they are looking 
                to learn Python with a specific interest in being able to build 
                a game
                Crowdfunders: Search by their skills to find a match that they are comfortable with. They can then pledge time to assist (such as 4x 1hr sessions)
